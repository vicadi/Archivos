<p>For the purposes of TOGAF 9, the following terms and definitions apply. <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/apdxa.html#tag_53"><i>A. Glossary of Supplementary Definitions</i></a> should be referenced for supplementary definitions not defined in this chapter. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary should be referenced for terms not defined in this section or <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/apdxa.html#tag_53"><i>A. Glossary of Supplementary Definitions</i></a>.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_01"></a>3.1 Abstraction</h3>

<p>The technique of providing summarized or generalized descriptions of detailed and complex content.</p>

<p>Abstraction, as in "level of abstraction", can also mean providing a focus for analysis that is concerned with a consistent and common level of detail or abstraction. Abstraction in this sense is typically used in architecture to allow a consistent level of definition and understanding to be achieved in each area of the architecture in order to support effective communication and decision-making. It is especially useful when dealing with large and complex architectures as it allows relevant issues to be identified before further detail is attempted.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_02"></a>3.2 Actor</h3>

<p>A person, organization, or system that has a role that initiates or interacts with activities; for example, a sales representative who travels to visit customers. Actors may be internal or external to an organization. In the automotive industry, an original equipment manufacturer would be considered an actor by an automotive dealership that interacts with its supply chain activities.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_03"></a>3.3 Application</h3>

<p>A deployed and operational IT system that supports business functions and services; for example, a payroll. Applications use data and are supported by multiple technology components but are distinct from the technology components that support the application.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_04"></a>3.4 Application Architecture</h3>

<h3><a name="tag_03_21"></a>3.21 Building Block</h3>

<p>Represents a (potentially re-usable) component of business, IT, or architectural capability that can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions.</p>

<p>Building blocks can be defined at various levels of detail, depending on what stage of architecture development has been reached.

Later on, a building block may be decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be accompanied by a full specification. Building blocks can relate to "architectures" or "solutions".</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_64"></a>3.64 Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h3>

<p>An architectural style that supports service orientation. It has the following distinctive features:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is based on the design of the services - which mirror real-world business activities - comprising the enterprise (or inter-enterprise) business processes.</li>

<li>Service representation utilizes business descriptions to provide context (i.e., business process, goal, rule, policy, service interface, and service component) and implements services using service orchestration.</li>

<li>It places unique requirements on the infrastructure - it is recommended that implementations use open standards to realize interoperability and location transparency.</li>

<li>Implementations are environment-specific - they are constrained or enabled by context and must be described within that context.</li>

<li>It requires strong governance of service representation and implementation.</li>

<li>It requires a "Litmus Test", which determines a "good service".</li>
